      <h2>Why Sunday Feast?</h2>
      <p>
        DJ Khamusique dreamed of being a celebrity, but life showed him a
        greater purpose. Through soulful deep house, food, and drinks,
        <strong>Sunday Feast</strong> is his gift to Bethlehem township: a
        space for joy, connection, and community.
      </p>
      <p>
        Khamusique is a dynamic DJ and producer from Bethlehem, Free State, South Africa. 
        His journey into music began in 2012, when he first stepped behind the decks and 
        discovered his passion for creating soulful, deep, and energetic house experiences.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over the years, Khamusique has built a strong reputation for delivering sets that 
        blend deep, soulful, and modern house sounds, always leaving the crowd captivated 
        and moving. His unique style is rooted in storytelling through music, drawing 
        inspiration from his surroundings and the diverse cultures of South Africa.
      </p>
      <p>
        From local stages in the Free State to performances across provinces and even 
        beyond South Africa’s borders into Lesotho, Khamusique continues to push his 
        brand and sound forward. His growth as an artist has also expanded into music 
        production, where he channels his creativity into original projects that showcase 
        his signature sound.
      </p>
      <p>
        Dedicated, passionate, and always evolving, Khamusique is more than a DJ — 
        he is a musical experience. With over a decade in the industry, his journey is 
        just beginning, and the best is yet to come.
